**#Object Detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once)**


Overview
Welcome to the Object Detection with YOLO project! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically YOLO, to perform real-time and individual frame object detection. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in a single frame.

Introduction
Object detection plays a crucial role in computer vision applications, and YOLO provides an efficient and accurate solution for this task. This project demonstrates how to implement object detection using the YOLO algorithm, enabling users to identify and locate objects within images or video streams.

Features
Real-time object detection.
Efficient detection of multiple objects in a single frame.
Easy-to-use implementation for both images and videos.
Customizable for training on specific datasets.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (version >= 3.x)
YOLO (Download and install the YOLO framework)
Additional dependencies (Install required Python packages)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run object detection on an image:

bash
Copy code
python detect_objects.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Run object detection on a video:

bash
Copy code
python detect_objects.py --video path/to/video.mp4
Customize the detection parameters in config.yaml for your specific needs.

Demo
Demo GIF/Video - Optional

Training Your Model
If you want to train the YOLO model on your custom dataset, follow the instructions in TRAINING.md.
