# *Object Detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once)*



## Overview

Welcome to the Object Detection with YOLO project! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically YOLO, to perform real-time and individual frame object detection. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in a single frame.

## Introduction

Object detection plays a crucial role in computer vision applications, and YOLO provides an efficient and accurate solution for this task. This project demonstrates how to implement object detection using the YOLO algorithm, enabling users to identify and locate objects within images or video streams.

## Features

Real-time object detection.
Efficient detection of multiple objects in a single frame.
Easy-to-use implementation for both images and videos.
Customizable for training on specific datasets.
